 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for profiles and photosheets.
 *   A user can only read, update, or delete their own profile.
 *   A user can only read, write, and list their own photosheets.
 *   Listing user documents is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * @dataStructure
 *   /users/{userId} (UserProfile):  User profile data.
 *   /users/{userId}/photosheets/{photosheetId} (Photosheet): Photosheets created by the user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is not allowed.
 *   - All write operations require authentication.
 *   - The rules for the photosheets subcollection grant list, read, and write access to the owner.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   The rules rely on path-based authorization. The `request.auth.uid` is matched against the `userId` path segment to ensure ownership.
